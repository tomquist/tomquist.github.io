I'm a software engineer and mobile technology enthusiast. I build stuff mainly for iOS and Android using Objective-C, Swift, Java and C# (Xamarin). I strongly believe that not focusing on a single platform, programming language or technology is the best way to learn new ways of thinking und to keep up to date. I'm on twitter ([@tomqueue](https://twitter.com/tomqueue)) though not very active. Sometimes you can see some activity on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/tomquist).
